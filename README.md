# Riot Forms (prototype)

**DISCLAIMER! This is still a very unstable prototype-grade code lacking proper test coverage. Use at own risk!**

This is a prototype of a library for working with forms in Riot. Hopefully, this 
prototype will lead to a working version and gets released. 

Features considered for inclusion:

* Form model, both JSON and FormData supported. (TODO)
* Support for dynamic and nested objects. (TODO)
* Validation, both declarative rule and custom logic supported. (TODO)
* Support for warnings. (TODO)
* Customizable validation error display. (TODO)
* Synchronous and asynchronous validation. (TODO)
* Reusable form parts with own set of validation rules. (TODO)

Riot Forms should be easy to use, but it also should not take any flexibility away.
